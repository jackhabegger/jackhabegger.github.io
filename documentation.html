            As I began to map out my plan of attack for this project, I knew that it would be important to gain a strong understanding of the data that I was going to be working with. I also made it a point to become familiar with John Snow's original map.
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            After reviewing the data and accounting for the project guidelines that instructed to create both "a timeline graph showing the number of deaths per day" and "additional graphs showing the distribution of deaths by sex and age overall", I decided to construct a line graph given that they are used to show how a measure changes over time and two separate bar graphs as they effectively compare measures of different groups.
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            As for the layout of the visualization page, I chose to center the map, or, the main visualization
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            While I could have used the provided 'deaths_age_sex.csv' file in it's raw state to create the two bar graphs, I decided to manipulate and clean the data using RStudio. Becasue each record of the 'deaths_age_sex.csv' file represented a single individual with numerical categorizations for their age and gender I chose to create two new separate files, 'male_female_deaths.csv' and 'age_range_deaths.csv', containing tablulated, summarised counts of each group. The contents of each file are shown below.

            When choosing which colors to use for both the webpage formatting and the collection of visualizations, I chose some colors arbitrarily and some that were intended to be symbolic in nature. I also wanted to choose an assortment of colors that would be easily visible and interpretable by those who are color blind or who have color impaired vision. I used Color Oracle, a product discussed in class, to test if the colors I used would be adequate for individuals with "Deuteranopia", "Protanopia", and "Tritanopia" forms of color blindness.
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            I arbitrarily selected navy to be the primary text color for both the visualization and documentation pages. I also chose navy to represent the individual points and bars for both the line graph and bar graphs. I then chose the light blue as a secondary color for the line in the line graph and the bar labels in the bar graphs. The light blue compliments the navy and provides a quality contrast between the key elements of each graph.
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            The remaining colors used in the map were chosen to be symbolic:
        </p>
        <li class="regulartext">Small, red circles - chosen to represent death</li>
        <li class="regulartext">Big, blue circles - chosen to represent water pumps</li>
        <li class="regulartext">Grey lines - chosen to represent streets. The color is dark enough to be easily noticable with the white background, but light enough to allow for the red and blue to stick out.</li>
        <li class="regulartext">Black street names - chosen to stick out relative to the grey stree lines, but not to overwhelm the red and blue.</li>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="subheading">Facts and Findings</h3>
        <p class="regulartext">
            The three visualizations I created, in addition to the re-creation of John Snow's map, allow for new insights to be made regarding the Cholera outbreak that Snow's original map was unable illistrate.
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            Firstly, the line graph chronologically displays the number of deaths that occured each day from August, 19th to September, 29th. We're able to see that the number of daily deaths peaked at 143 on September 2nd followed by 116 on September, 3rd. This raises the question of whether or not the Broad Street pump was used at an above-average rate a few days prior? We're also able to see that over 90%, or 522 of the 571 total deaths, occured over a 10-day period ranging from August 31st to September 9th.
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            The modernized map allows the viewer to more easily see the location of each death, the location of each water pump, major landmarks, and major streets. The majority of deaths appear to be centrally located around the Broad Street pump, however there are a few 'outlier' deaths. Did those individuals work or travel near the pumps? Or did they come in contact with individuals who already had the disease?
        </p>
        <p class="regulartext">
            Lastly, the remaining bar graphs break down the totality of death that occured during the outbreak across the demographics of both gender and age. As expected, there was no gender bias with the deaths caused by Cholera - the number of deaths for both males (284) and females (287) were nearly identical. Additionally, the age graph shows that the outbreak affected the youth (ages 1-10) and the elderly (age 80+) the most.
